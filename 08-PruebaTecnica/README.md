### Objective

This challenge aims to evaluate basic skills in React development. The idea is to build an simple data query website for music bands.

- Login/authentication page. The rest of the pages have to be behind this "authorization wall".
- List and navigate bands.<br/>
  Filter and sorting should be enabled.
- View information of a specific band, including albums and members.
- Logout

### Model & API

This is the API URL (using [My JSON Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/)):<br/>
https://my-json-server.typicode.com/improvein/dev-challenge

You can check the documentation for "JSON Server" to see how to interact with the API via filters, pagination, etc:<br/>
